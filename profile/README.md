# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I write software, and run validators. Notable works:

## Badges

An NFT protocol that allows anyone to permissionlessly create digital badges.

- [badges](https://github.com/steak-enjoyers/badges) - smart contracts
- [badges.js](https://github.com/steak-enjoyers/badges.js) - TypeScript SDK, generated by Cosmoslogy ts-codegen
- [badges-webapp](https://github.com/steak-enjoyers/badges-webapp) - frontend for interacting with Badges contracts

## Steak

Liquid staking protocol implemented in [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/). Originally launched on Terra Classic, it has been forked by multiple teams and deployed on Terra2, Juno, and Osmosis.

- [steak](https://github.com/steak-enjoyers/steak) - smart contracts
- [steak-webapp](https://github.com/steak-enjoyers/steak-webapp) - frontend for interacting with Steak contracts

## Tooling

- [cw-plus-plus](https://github.com/steak-enjoyers/cw-plus-plus) - a collection of CosmWasm utilities
